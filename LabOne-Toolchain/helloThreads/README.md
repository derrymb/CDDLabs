maybe firgue out how to get the "Launched from the main" print out to go last
# Files       
*main.cpp contains the threads that we want to order the flow of control of
*Semaphore.cpp contains the class semaphore and its functions
*Semaphore.h contains the c++ header for the implementation of semaphores

# Info          
this lab was to get us to understand how to use semaphores to order the flow of threads \
using semaphore.Wait() and semaphore.Signal() to order the threads how we want then to run
